				<h3>Millionaire Pie</h3>
			</header>
			<div>
				<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>2C sifted powdered sugar</li>
					<li>1/4lb butter, softened</li>
					<li>2 large eggs</li>
					<li>1/8t salt</li>
					<li>1/4t pure vanilla</li>
					<li>2 (9inch) pie crusts, baked</li>
					<li>1C heavy cream</li>
					<li>1/2C sifted powdered sugar</li>
					<li>1 can crushed pineapple, drain well</li>
					<li>1/2C chopped pecans</li>
				<h2>Directions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Cream 2 cups powdered sugar and butter with electric mixer until fluffy (be SURE to do this step first).</li>
					<li>Add eggs, salt and vanilla. Beat until light and fluffy.</li>
					<li>Spread mixture evenly into baked pie crusts, then chill.</li>
					<li>Whip heavy cream until stiff. Blend in powdered sugar. Then fold in pineapple and pecans.</li>
					<li>Spread mixture on top of chilled filling; and chill thoroughly before serving.</li>
					<li>NOTE: This pie is sweet and not for diabetics. But if you make your own powdered sugar by grinding Splenda into a powder, you can eat some too.</li>
					<li>TIP For Diabetics: *To make your homemade powdered sugar from Splenda...take 1 cup Splenda and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, using a clean coffee grinder (or a blender) place both ingredients in the cup, placeing the lid on and pulse into a powder form. This can be used for dusting cakes, cupcakes...etc. You can also make a frosting with it.</li>
					<li>Frosting made with Homemade Powdered Sugar: 8 ounces low-fat cream cheese 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/4 cup light butter Beat 8 oz of cream cheese with the butter. Mix in vanilla and 1/2 cup of the home made powdered sugar (taste it as you go).</li>

				<h3>Pie Tip: How To Roll Out Pie Dough Without a Rolling Pin</h3>
			</header>
			<div>
				<p> Use a chilled wine bottle. This is rather brilliant on more than one level. Yes, it means you don't need to own a rolling pin (saving a little space in your cupboards), but it's also good for the pie dough. You want to keep traditional pie dough as cold as possible all through the rolling-out and shaping process, so a chilled bottle of wine is a very good idea.</p>
				<p>We would just suggest wiping down the bottle to remove any condensation; you don't want to add extra moisture to your dough.</p>

				<h3>Pie Tip: Use Rice Flour to Roll Your Crust</h3>
			</header>
			<div>
				<p>The reason for this is that rice has no gluten and so it won't contribute to toughness. Rice flour is no different to work with than regular flour when rolling out pie dough. Just sprinkle it on your surface and pin and get rolling.</p>
